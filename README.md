My software exercise for CoE 164 (Computing Platforms)

Create a system that converts the numerical amount into Filipino currency in words.

Input
The input starts with a number 𝑇 on a single line denoting the number of remittance forms.
𝑇 lines then follow, with each line denoting the numeral amount written on the form. Each
line consists of two space-separated nonnegative integers 𝑝 𝑐 denoting the whole Pesos
and Centavos, respectively.

Output
The output consists of 𝑇 lines, with each line denoting the corresponding form in the input.
Each line should be of the format 𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒 #𝑡: 𝑊 where 𝑡 is the serial of the test case starting
from 1 and 𝑊 the amount written in Filipino. The amount should be written in all lowercase
letters.

Both 𝑝 and 𝑐 can never be zero.

Assume that all of the inputs are well-formed and are always provided within these constraints.
It is not required to handle any errors.
